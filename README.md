# 🗒️🗒️ Project Implementation 🗒️🗒️

### Architecture & Component Design
I implemented a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes reusability:

- [x] Clean project structure with separate components, routes, and configuration
- [x] Modular component design (NavBar, NavItem, Header, etc.)
- [x] Single source of truth for route configuration
- [x] Type safety with TypeScript interfaces and proper typing


### Reusability & Maintainability
Created highly reusable components with proper TypeScript interfaces:
- [x] Created reusable components (Input, Tabs, ProfileForm)
- [x] Centralized route configuration makes it easy to add/modify routes
- [x] DRY principles followed throughout the codebase
- [x] Consistent code style and formatting

### Responsive Design:

Implemented a mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints using tailwind.

### Technical Decisions & Rationale

1. TypeScript: Chose TypeScript for:
    - [x] Type safety across the application
    - [x] Better developer experience
    - [x] Catch errors during development
    - [x] Enhanced code documentation

2. Tailwind CSS: Selected for:
    - [x] Rapid development
    - [x] Consistent styling
    - [x] Built-in responsive design
    - [x] Zero runtime CSS-in-JS overhead

3. Component Structure: 
    - [x] Atomic design principles
    - [x] Reusable components
    - [x] Clear separation of concerns

4. Future Improvements
    - [x] State Management
    - [x] Testing
    - [x] Performance Monitoring
  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
